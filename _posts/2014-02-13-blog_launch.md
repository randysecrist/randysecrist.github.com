I recently re-discovered my github user page and looked upon it in horror. If
you somehow saw this atrocity, please try to unsee it.

Long ago, I ran my own web server at home and spent a lot of time doing a mix
of varied consulting work that involved both the front and back end.  After
college, I focused more on the backend aspect of software development and forgot
there was such a thing as HTML or CSS.  In a big company, that is perfectly
fine, there is always someone else besides me that does the UI job, usually using
a nice editor that I would simply not shell out the money for unless I did it
every day.

As this is the first time I have written anything public for a while that is
not on twitter or facebook, things you can expect to find on here are my
thoughts on things that interest me.  I have been a long time believer in
doing projects like this on the side, it helps me keep a whole host of skills
fresh.

Interests I have are:

1.  Written Language (English or 한국어)
2.  Making useful things using ...
  1.  Erlang
  2.  Java / Scala
  3.  C / Objective C
  4.  Ruby
  5.  Arduino
  6.  Raspberry PI

If I add more functionality, I may write more about random thoughts around the
latest [Peter Balis](https://twitter.com/pbailis) papers, but only once there is
a mechanism on site to interact with all of you.  You can always find me on the
[twitterz](https://twitter.com/randysecrist).

Until then, I hope you find what you are looking for.
